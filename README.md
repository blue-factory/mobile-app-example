# Nearby Places Mobile App Example

Example for mobile app to find nearby places with microservice oriented architecture. The mobile application is implemented by [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and in it users can search for nearby restaurants according to the GPS coordinate.

The backend architecture depends on a network of microservices that communicate through [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) for external access, [Grpc](https://grpc.io/) for internal back-end communications and [NATS](https://nats.io/) for asynchronous communication processes.

The infrastructure was implemented with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), using recipes associated with the implementation of a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster through the [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/kubernetes-service/) (AKS). On the other hand, there is also a service mesh implemented in [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/) that allows you to manage package tracking between microservices, service logs, infrastructure metrics with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)/[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) and other things.

It is possible to use [Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/) to run a cluster through [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube). In this way, each functionality will be tested in the most similar way to the production environment.

## Service Architecture

The solution is composed of 5 microservices written in various languages. The main repository (where we are now) is a monorepo but each of the services has its respective repository and everything is linked through the Git sub-modules.

| [Gateway Service](https://github.com/microapis/gateway-api/)         | Typescript | service that acts as a 'data aggregation layer' through GraphQL. Through it you can access the resources provided by the back-end microservices.                 |

| [Auth Service](https://github.com/microapis/auth-api/)               | Golang     | Microservice implemented in Typecript that allows authenticating access to the backend through a JWT token. On the other hand, it manages user signup and login. |
| [Restaurants Service](https://github.com/microapis/restaurants-api/) | Golang     | Microservice implemented in Golang that get nearby restaurants from Google Places API.                                                                           |
| [History Service](https://github.com/microapis/history-api/)         | Golang     | The microservice implemented in Golang saves the history associated with searches performed in the restaurant service.                                           |
